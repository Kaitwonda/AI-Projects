Test: Learn TensorFlow in a Week
This repository is dedicated to learning TensorFlow by building three progressively complex AI projects in seven days. Each project focuses on a different core skill — starting with practical classification, then emotional context, and finally recursive symbolic modeling.

The goal isn’t to perfect every system immediately — it’s to build real, functional AIs fast, while layering deeper capabilities as you go.

Project Progression
1. Handy Car Rental AI
Goal: Build a basic intent classifier to assist customers in a car rental scenario.
Focus:

Standard NLP preprocessing
Intent detection (no emotions or memory)
Professional, template-based replies
Use case: Could be deployed in a business setting with zero personality tuning.
Time estimate: 1 day
2. Kim’s Convenience AI
Goal: Add emotional awareness and casual response generation in a retail support bot.
Focus:

Sentiment analysis (happy, upset, confused, etc.)
Mode switching: product help vs. emotional support (gossip/venting)
Early multi-turn awareness
Use case: Mimics a more human conversation with emotional tracking.
Time estimate: 2–3 days
3. SPO-B (Symbolic Processing Overload Benchmark)
Goal: Research-grade model capable of testing symbolic density, recursion, and emergent behavior.
Focus:

High-complexity prompts
Long-term context simulation
Recursive thought structure and symbolic drift measurement
Use case: Experimental platform for testing memory, meaning, and mythic AI design.
Time estimate: 3–4 days (ongoing R&D-style development)
Why symbols?
Symbolism is the most powerful way to expand intelligence — because it holds emotion, stories, and mathematics in a single structure.

Learning Objectives
Understand how text tokenization, intent classification, and embedding layers work in TensorFlow
Build models with multiple output heads (e.g., intent + emotion)
Manage increasing input complexity across projects
Gain confidence in using TensorFlow’s core APIs for NLP-focused applications
Structure
Each project has its own folder:

/HandyCarRentalAI
/KimsConvenienceAI
/SPO-B-Research
Each folder contains:

Notebook(s)
Sample training data
Model checkpoints
Response templates (if used)
Status
This repo is active and being built in real-time, in public. Expect occasional chaos. That’s how learning works.
